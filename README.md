Uncomplicated Application-level Vehicular Communication And Networking. 

# libuavesp
UAVCAN library for Espressif microcontrollers. (Arduino SDK)

### Library Features
* Full rewrite for ESP8266 (soon ESP32)
* Transports over 
  * Serial Hardware UART
  * Serial TCP/IP tunnel
  * Serial Loopback
  * Debug interface
* Application-level server and client functions for:
  * Heartbeat
  * NodeInfo
  * PortInfo
* Extensible framework makes it trivial to add new functions.

### UAVCAN Features:
* Democratic network â€“ no bus master, no single point of failure.
* Publish/subscribe and request/response (RPC) exchange semantics.
* Efficient exchange of large data structures with automatic decomposition and reassembly.
* Lightweight, deterministic, easy to implement, and easy to validate.
* Suitable for deeply embedded, resource constrained, hard real-time systems.
* Specialized interface description language provides rich zero-cost data type and interface abstractions.
* Usable with different transport protocols.
* Supports dual and triply modular redundant transports.
* Supports high-precision network-wide time synchronization.
* High-quality open source reference implementations are freely available under the MIT license.
